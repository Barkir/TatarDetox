Patriotism? Ha, I'm Tatar, maybe you're Russian, I won't be a patriot for the sake of Russia, sorry...
I'll tell you my name, let's see what you'll do!
What's the point of arguing about something you love?!

Nightmare. Priests and mullahs are taking over

Hey, why did you delete the comment? I'll come and kick you!
Girls! Don't think about getting married, it's true! Where will we find pure Tatar girls?....
post a beautiful photo, and take this down!
and you're also a pain!
I don't like conversation.
well, nothing special, get out of here, don't bother me, you're annoying... I have no words!
In Aktanysh, not a single normal girl is left! My friend says: -you'll dance with anyone!
There's no one better than a person who abandons their child and gives the parents' house to the child!
live without brains, friends!!!! if you stick your finger in your ear, you won't become someone else!
Those girls writing in Russian and Tatar at the same time!
he worked at the AvtoVAZ factory, the hands of the car assemblers were covered in dirt and scratches!
you're our symbol! look at your own face!
what kind of thing is this in Archa!!!
You have to eat like an animal and even if you're dirty, you have to clean up!
write in Tatar, and don't be naive!
let's go have fun!) and it's cool
It doesn't matter what anyone says, you won't listen anyway.
to all admins, please, don't post fish photos... don’t waste time here.... I’ll repeat it again!!! there’s no ban on fish topics in the group!!!
Girls you're brakes, because of your braking, you'll lose such cool guys!!!
haha, don't get angry, do you think that's a pimple or something?
where will you go, sit in my place and try to touch me, you won't be able to, you're not like me!!!!
friends, look, what are the Russians writing?
what kind of scream is that? does it sound like me?
And nothing will happen to you, just a sweetie, eat and enjoy:)
Guys will write that you are dating other guys?! What is this.
Don't bother me with your nonsense – go away!
So you'll just go to those boys now!
@user, I thought you were joking at first. But it's true, I guess.
You like it when I'm nice to you, but why do you call them skimpidars?
Ugh, that's it, I've had enough! You, you...
Niyaz, if you're going to be a monkey... just make some noise and I'll understand!!
Friends will understand, do as you please. Should you dump the guy if he's not a good friend?
If you're going to be bad, then that guy is not a person, just bad!!!
Take your rag and go to the library
Tatars live with Russians!?
Your rag is torn, can't you see?!
Delete their number and don't go to their room, don’t see them, respect yourself!
Ah, you like those boys, like them!
So we won't have dinner, we have to get up early, no sleeping in!!
Who watches hockey? Ak Bars, yeah!
Ah, you're going to change me, right? Your rag is ready, I know, what's your plan?
If you drive recklessly, the driver is to blame! They don't follow traffic rules!
By the way, I told you that you can't come to my place, don't make me kick you out!
My daughter, just take your rag, read books, and sleep!!
I was waiting for you, but you jumped up from the couch and left, I don't like you now!
You asked me who I am, and I'll tell you exactly when I’ll come to your place
What's wrong with you? Say it in Tatar!
Take your fish and go, open the fishermen's group and post your photos!
There are many marjas... they don't need anything...
@user, you're a provocateur! You insult the Tatar nation!!
Kazan is in Tatarstan, and Tatarstan is in Russia. Don't be ashamed of your nationality!
Friends, if you take your rag and throw it away, our roads will be better!
I said I wouldn't look at them, but they've been celebrating all week
You're just a TV series, marja, go see a doctor, it won't hurt!!
Some marjas want to be with me.
You need to sew your shirt and fix the hole
What's wrong with you? I've never heard the saying'sew your shirt'!
@user, what's wrong with you? Can't you understand that they're just teasing you? Friends will find each other, right?
Sew your head!!! And fix your shirt!!!
@user, if I were Russian, would I say something like that? Would I understand
And by the way, you say you're busy, but you just hang out with your friends and have fun, while I'm happy to just sit in the office and drink tea.
Tatar patriot... at first, I wrote in marja, but then I switched to Tatar, good job!!
If you call, the monkeys will come to see you!!
I just need to wipe my nose, my nose is fine, don't worry, it's okay, if it gets worse, I'll go again.
If I were that girl, I'd go and talk to her nicely and make her feel better.
I turned on the car's hazard lights and drove away, you know, like a real driver
In Chally, if a marja learns to speak a different language, I'll tear them apart!
What are you selling? Anonymously!
We're just wasting our lives behind the screen... that's the problem - our minister doesn't care.
Tatar girls don't like you, marja, take them! They won't give their daughters to anyone, they wrote.
You're just having fun, right? (roughly speaking) what's the point of going out if you're not going to have fun?
Blackmail is not good, you're not thinking
Language... many sick people are silent, they're afraid to live.
Yes, Babai is beautiful! Although Putin's tears, they sit like monkeys, uff!
If there were more posts like this, I would like it, but if not, I don't care, it's just a waste of money.
those people who mess with others' heads! They are useless!
Gather your friends and go to their place as guests. Ask them 'Did you order striptease?'
I'm tired of this... Let's just speak nicely and wear red panties, okay?
Should I write in Tatar so that people won't understand?
I've started to believe that there's a reason for everything.
Of course, it's a celebration! This is the site of pop stars, not a site, after all!
If I wanted, I could do it too, but I don't need to
They will take out their anger on someone else. Do not provoke the nation!
Girls, how can you not be ashamed? Wear a skirt and a pair of tights!
I'm tired of your arguing! You speak different languages, you don't understand each other, and you don’t listen to each others.
Oh it's so hard, I don't know how to get out of here, I wrote this to help, but it didn't work.
We can live next to Russians. Have you ever heard of a tatar who gave a Tatar name to their child who married a Russian?
The officials who are higher up don't have enough money, and the people are suffering... That's why the prices are rising.
Take care, don't be shy!
They are bad people. Let it be - just throw away your money, if you can afford it.
Respect to Syumbel and Ilnur, they don't write nonsense under posts like other people, them write based on their thoughts!
Why do they call the Tatar language a 'collective farm'? - they talk like monkeys! That's what I think!
Stop yelling, I'm tired of it
It's a shame. Keep going in the same spirit!
Don't sell your conscience. If you had such thoughts, you would be doing something useful, not just talking.
Yes, some people are Russified! Get out, speak Tatar, and answer in Tatar, that's the only way to get a decent response!
What language is this? Can't you speak properly?
Tatars, it seems, are pulling each other down, and that's not right!
Let there be money, and let there be people!
If they start writing spam in Tatar, it's going to be a disaster!
Haha, you can't even start a sentence... You're just like that!
Don't talk nonsense, it's not good...
Look at them, they just swear and use bad words, that's all they can do.
I'll give it to you! Why? Because! You can't handle the truth!
Who cares, it's just bad, let there be cleanliness!
If they were normal, they wouldn't be anonymous, and their words would be normal too! So keep quiet and listen!
Check your lives, you're just wasting time!
If you're not drunk, and you didn't spend all your money on vodka, what can you tell us?
So that Ivan would at least understand us in Tatarstan...
There shouldn't be people writing in the Tatar group!
If they wrote something interesting, people would read it with more interest...
These people are annoying me... It's not Tataria, it's Tatarstan!
I'll throw them out of the car and make them quiet.
Bulat you're right! Russians say 'Russia for Russians', and they consider Tatars to be second-class citizens...
You follow people and yell at them, but when they respond, you can't handle it... Your words are just empty talk.
There are people everywhere, even in Aktanysh... I need to get out of here!
Honestly, I'm shocked... Alsu, don't you feel ashamed?
Don't talk nonsense, it's not worth it... Did you even think about what you're saying?
You're just talking nonsense!
Andrey, I think you love Russians too much... Is your wife Russian?
Female logic is weird, I'll take the wheat and leave the chaff!
A real person wouldn't write like that, it's just bad!
It's a shame, you'll be killed, you lovers of controversy!
At night, when you get up, you will be very hungry.
I will feed the baby.
Two nipples, which one to choose
The other one is for the older child.
Don't say a word, just get on the bed and lie down, and cover yourself with a blanket!!!
You need to get up early, and at that exact time, you will go
Do you want to buy blue eyes?
On Saturday, it's like that at the wedding.
Raph, it's like that, almost finished
We Tatars have one word.
Mister, I don't like it, men with many women.
Don't be like that, if you have a Tatar wife, you will be very happy, but if you has a lazy husband, he will not work, and he will be useless.
Informant, you are an informant.
This is not an animal, it's a donkey, grab the pot and hit it on the head, and throw the kettle.
To hit her, you need to be careful.
I will start crying now.
For girls, it's necessary to shout and scold.
The boys, like this.
The chairman's face.
If you try once, you will be good, but if you don't, you'll be bad.
And there is no group.
You need a big horse.
If you castrate, you will become eunuch, my friend.
Go to the doctor, and you will be cured.
Viktor, you don't need to masturbate, you are a young boy.
You are not smart.
Marat, I will come to you, to the barrel, but I am too big.
You need to hit your head, you have a fever, and you fell unconscious, and at that time, your friends will come to help you.
Look, in the photos, there are homosexuals.
Mermaids have tails.
Every year, they eat fish heads.
In Georgia, they protest for a better life, but in Russia, people are forced to give up their cars and stay at home without rights
The devil took your soul
After nine months, you will be born, and then you will have sex.
Some people know how to live.
If you cross the red line, you will be punished.
I will teach you.
Sit further, look at the TV.
This is your day, March 8th, women's day.
It's true.
Now take the pillow and hit him.
Yes, say it, old cartilage
You learned to write in Tatar, really.
The road is closed.
Don't cook from the beginning.
You are happy, but you didn't think about your health.
Hey, where are you, did you get lost, or are you still the same, your wife's shoes are not good.
You have a very bad mouth.
He is hitting you, but you don't care.
It's just a hole until it's torn

Is that a toilet? Look, don't touch
learn to speak first
I'll come and mess with your mother
Tatars are bad, they're all perverts
Transvestite or unpleasant person, what's the difference
That's what I think, people with heart problems will die from fear
They'll be scared
What's your problem?
Who do you think you are
People like you are everywhere, you can be anyone, but you're still not smart
You're not educated.
That's what you need
I'll give you soap as a gift
Here's your soap, take it and go
go away
You need that.
Show me your body.
If she's a girl, how perverted can she be
They probably hurt your mother, no blood came out
You're always in the toilet, only books and toilet, you're the owner of the toilet
Your mother is a passageway to the yard
I'll mess with your mother too
The people were stiff.
This group is always full of bad men.
The girl is not smart.
Beat him with oil
Who eats that
That's the real Tatar couch
I'm not smart, I'll mess with you.
Now they are sitting in this group, they're just bad people
What's this, if it's a street dog, it’s understandable
Can't just talk, need to kick and scream, get out of here
Who says Ivan is not smart
If you talk about people like that, I'll punish you
Some kind of transgender
What a bad person
You have such a big belly.
I have syphilis, but I'll still mess with you
You're mine
take the garbage and go, if you touch, I'll kick you
Put the condom on, in the name of God, I'll give you the handjob
Open your mouth
Not you.
I'll come in an hour.
If I don't eat you, I'm not a man
Do you call me a gift?
They called him a bad mouth
I'll leave your mouth, these people are dogs, the bad people are left behind
Well, I'm telling you, when there's no one around, they say, "Idiots!!!"
@user, What are you talking about?!
@user, Shut up! All women do that!
You're talking about us like we're bad! Look at the comments and tweets of the girls you like and see for yourself!
It's not obligatory to listen to you!
Who were outside this morning, yelling and screaming?
Are there any young people in Aktanish? Except for the unsuitable people, of course.
There are many people in the world, shameless. They do whatever they want, right?
Look at that now. He's working, and his wife is here, playing around and flirting! What a mess!
What are you staring at? Take this woman and leave, she's ruining the wedding!
Don't swear, don't say!
Here are your motivators! Get up and eat less!
It's all here now. For girls, it's about bad, and for boys, it’s all about bad.
They call it a monster, but what kind of monster is it?
It's better to leave than to get a certificate of ignorance!
Wow, what kind of things are you writing?
You must have lost a good girl, huh? How else can you be so naive?
Here's amoron. Be a girl and keep quiet!
Bulat, don't keep quiet here, either. Let's talk.
Here are the people of Aktanish.
It can't be helped, it's better if they don't go out on the street at all
You all talk and talk, but what's the point of your words?
What's the name of that thing you're talking about? It's a person, after all. You have a bad name, too!
Do you understand? Your theory doesn't make sense... That thing is just bad.
It's called a French kiss, but it's not about putting your tongue in someone's mouth!
How much does it cost to buy a tractor? I'm fed up with you!
In Aktanish, who's driving a black BMW?
These people yell like that!
That person found it on Google or Yandex, of course. It's not like they have minds of their own.
I could even kill them with a key!
I couldn't finish watching it until the end. Something's wrong with my head because of these people.
In Aktanish, people don't know anything except how to chain-smoke.
A person's happiness is not in their wealth. I don't understand those women
Who's talking?!
You're not Even a man, you're just bad.
Is there a \"guy\" in Aktanish who doesn't swear at girls?
Even girls prefer good guys.
The Nazis only know how to do one thing!
You need to be naive to think like that!
I want to tell that guy to get his act together
Seriously, what kind of nonsense are you talking about? To me, it's just ignorance.
@user, I know how to argue better than you! Don't yell, I'll come back and respond
How can someone be so handsome, but also be drunk?
So, guys, you invite girls on dates, right? Be a normal guy!
Shut up!
The \"Krymna\" people are destroying our thoughts.
Girls, why do you post such photos? If you were lesbians, that would be one thing, but you're not, so it's not beautiful.
That person doesn't ask, they just take.
Who do you think you are, talking about women like that?
Just do it, don't talk (I'm fed up)!
Not provided
This is not similar to anything! Do not compare people to animals, just leave it alone!
Is this a joke? I'm talking to you, not you! You're so stupid, what a pity!
I really hate you, if I loved you, I wouldn't say such things
Who told you to keep quiet?
The Aktanysh traffic police have become very rude, they stop you at every corner
Just leave me alone, that's enough!!
In Turlat, some guys flirt with girls, and then insult them, what's your name?
Girls who smoke are bad!!!
Why don't you speak Tatar with pleasure and fill your mouth with words?
You don't understand anything!
If you're not Tatar, I'll smash your head!
Do you want to play with me? I didn't start it, but Islam is the religion of our nation! I said that Jews kill Muslims in Palestine
Oh, my brother!!! it's written like that, I don't understand what's happening:D
I called you, didn't you hear me?! You don't know how to dress, you can't behave in public, you're like an old woman, just sitting in a corner!
If my dog looked at me like that, I'd cut its head off
There's no need to get upset here, just think before you write!
Guys, don't pay attention to such people!
Just walk and drink vodka, lose your mind and curse Russian children!
These people always want to mess!
Don't call it an infantry, it's an unmanned drone bombing, American war!
I wear panties and I'm not ashamed of it
They don't even know how to wear pants!!!
This post is so true!!
And they take unmarried girls and sit with them, talking.
Scammers, shop owners, and health inspectors.
You always defend bad people, go away!
What's your name? Don't comment if you don't understand!
I was just joking but seriously, why do you always appear in comments?
Don't hit people with your hands!
I'd die if I were in your place.
The question they ask: What's your name? Like I don't know!
A woman opened the door of her apartment on the first floor and left.
The owner of the house went and said, then our woman went to the apartment and locked the door, and the woman who opened the door was left outside
The guy has a dog that barks at the door!
Tatar guys speak Russian, not Tatar, what's wrong with you?!
Why do dogs always sit in this group? Don't bring dogs here.
I want to meet you in person!
Who will choose whom? You or me? You'll understand after the wedding...
What kind of question are you asking? Don't ask wrong questions!
I don't like pure girls.
This cat is very fat!!
The owners of these dogs should be locked in a bank vault!
@user, 'Russians ate'- they say that about people like you. You're a victim of zombification
You joined a group and mock our parents' religion - you're not afraid of Allah?!
Please, if you write in Tatar, write in Tatar, and if you wrote in Russian, write Russian...
Boris Yeltsin was drunk, he sold Russia, and Putin tried to catch up, but he's still trying!
You don't need a car, you need money!
Timur, there's no need to give your girlfriend to any guy!
Haha, it's just scary! Don't be afraid
Well, they have started to get angry!
Not a single dog is barking at the cuckoo! Maybe they are tired of barking?
On the contrary, men buy it, even the dumbest ones, it's a shame to call them men!
I'm so fed up! I want to get to know them, but they are not interested!
They are so annoying!!!
What kind of people are you, Vadim? We don't have anyone to consider as a friend.
Get out! Where have you been?
From the very beginning, I was worried that one of my two children would disappear. Oh no, it's a tragedy
I once left a bucket and a pail outside, and someone took them. I'm not surprised, of course, brother.
I'm not surprised, of course, brother
I have a friend who loves Zemfira. I really love her too!!! How can we find a compromise?
When will this group stop writing on the phone??? It's annoying.
A person who doesn't know anything started talking, and now everyone is listening...
It seems that there's no difference between Tatars and Mishars, and it's not true to say that Mishar don't like Tatars. You can't even tell who's Tatar and who’s Mishar.
He showed me the 'kukish', closed the door, and leaned against it from the inside
Regarding the restaurant, it's not important, just look at the green walls!
Hey people! Answer me! What kind of chemistry are you talking about? A person asks for help, and you respond like drug addicts.
I'm so surprised that when I came to Kazan from the village, Tatars speak Russian with each other!
@user, just look at what I wrote, where did I write that? Change the record. One of my hobbies is eating fish heads
I know the Russian group, I listened to the audio recording of Lev Leshchenko, where is the Tatar language? You are faithless, I'll leave this, may God protect me!
I'm against the referendum, it's not needed.
Oh, you've finally added our songs to your repertoire, copying from other groups! Can't you write two lines of your own?
strange people, you've been to the supermarket, but you don't know where the hookah is. Which room is it in?
We need to take a photo... we need to get to know each other (to Tatar guys)
Don't behave like Churkas. Live quietly.
At first I started writing something, but then I got distracted by something else...
'Well done'? If someone touches your wife's stomach, they will be praised
I've never seen such a road in Ufa, even when I was leaving Ufa. Don't make fun of Bashkortostan!
Don't talk nonsense, what kind of Russians are you? Tatar girls who respect their elders don't behave like that.
What's wrong with you? Those ticket inspectors are yelling at us like we're guilty of something.
Shut up!
What's wrong with you? Those girls who wear short skirts!
If that girl was in front of me, I would scream 'You're crazy!!!'
Tanzilya, take care of your head, you need them to live.
Be more polite, please!!! Or you'll be like terrorists!!
Tatar girls should never marry Russians!!!
Why do you always write in Russian? All your posts are in Russian. You're not Tatars, you're Russian!
Do you want to make a subordinate out of me?
What a bad person you are. I don't want to be like that!
Only an animal can behave like that!
Do you think I live in a bad country?
Take care of your belly, boy, be careful!
I think people are not bad here.
You're not even listening to me.
I'm telling the truth, when I see a Tatar girl with a Russian guy, I want to kill them!
If they write in Tatar, they start talking, but here they wrote in Russian. It's clear: they've been sold to the Russians!
A girl loves my boyfriend, and I want to kill her.
And in Tatarstan, they don't ask what Tatars need, it just do what they want!
Oh, I wish I could catch that person... There's no one like Aktanish who can talk back!
You just sit there and write 'nu sin bit', it's so rude, Aynur!
What kind of thing is this? Don't bother me with your empty talk!
What's wrong with you? Those girls who wear short skirts!
Pilet quickly ran out, what's going on?!
Speak Tatar
What's up, anyway, let's go, shall we?:)
Our people are dying, and you're not even worried?! What's wrong with you? I love Marzhan, should I go and get lost or what?!
Take and kick out our \"sekim de\" from among our people!
Be careful with your fakes
Why do you communicate with each other like this?
What a spring, the water is cold, let's drink
Almir, for them it's all the same, urine or water
Gulnara, how much time has passed, it seems
The main thing is cleanliness!
Matvey, I asked you how the internet is.
I'm tired of your meaningless conversations.
You're flirting with other girls, and then you scold them
Well, you're all just girls..
If girls went to the army, would the guys be able to handle it? I don't think so!
Why do you behave like this?!
There are no girls who want to get out, because of the Etkei and Enkei clans
Most girls behave like this, they flirt with guys and then ignore them, and in the end they just choose one
Hey, hey, anonymous, don't flirt with me on my photos! You're "neste"!!!
We don't care, but we express our opinions
Are you tired of us?! Do you want to be friends or what?
You are completely impotent, why do you write like this?
Tatar guys are like this when they think about girls, look and see
I'm free now! What was I waiting for?
Don't write such words, \"show your level\", I'm tired of you!
You should wash your hands, why are you sitting there, anonymous?
What's your business here?! Is it your problem or what?
It's not a shame to ask questions, but it's a bad thing to sit like you
We're not brave, but our people agree with us, and they just look at us
I'm tired of this, every time you write nonsense..
You're worse than the people in the market, you just sit and chat
What's wrong with you...
Get out of here, I'll throw you out if you say one more word
And then you start flirting right away - showing off, the football players will see you, no need for that
Sit on your own are you kidding me?
How many people have you deceived?
Tatars are always like this
Lesya, a horse in a saddle, if you don't know what to do, don’t touch it.
Get out, Gata!
Look, they're walking like a goat
What's beauty got to do with it, what's the point of talking about beauty?
I wrote this for the nest, I love you
This is made for blacks, I won't take it
Girls, if your guys want to have sex, what will you do?
I'm tired of your questions where can I study?, not anonymous
Where were you, I haven't seen you around here
I'm tired of your Vatsap
Now I think, I'm tired of you
Yes I'll sit in the toilet and think..)
This cuckoo's child is not even a dog, it's not worth giving it away!
On the contrary, men buy them, and even the mind is not enough to give them away!
I'm tired of them!! I want to get to know them, but not like this!
They are so annoying!!!
What kind of Mishars are you, Vadim? - We don't have anyone to consider as a relative! Leave now, Don't say words that don’t make sense!!
Well, he has taken him. Where have you been, little one?
From the beginning, two children came out, one of them disappeared. Aaah, no one is left.
A month ago, I caught a big pike and took it home! If I were a liar, I wouldn't say it, but of course, brother, I'm telling the truth:-D
If I were a liar, I wouldn't say it, but of course, brother, I'm telling the truth
I know a girl who loves Zemfira. And I really love her!!! How can we find a compromise, huh??!
When will this group's nonsense end??? It's annoying!
A person who doesn't know anything started talking nonsense...
In short, there's no difference between Mishars and Tatars, it's not true that Mishar don't like Tatars. You can't even tell who's Tatar and who’s Mishar!!!
He showed the “kukish”, slammed the door shut, and propped it up with a wardrobe from the inside.
Regarding the restaurant, it's nothing, only the green walls are still standing.
Hey people! Tell me! What kind of chemistry are you on? A person asks for help, and you answer like addicts
I was very surprised when I came to Kazan from the village, Tatars speak Russian with each other!
@user, rewrite the course, where did I say that I didn't write to you? Change the record. If I had a hobby, I'd be a fisherman
I know the Russian group, I listened to the audio recording of Lev Leshchenko, where is it written in Tatar? I'll leave this place, don't worry about Allah's judgment!!!
I'm like this - without a referendum, they took away our referendum.
They already have our repertoire, they just copy records from other groups! Can't you think of two sentences yourself?
They bypassed the whole supermarket and found a hookah with grass. Which cabin is it in?
Taking a photo... we need to get acquainted!!!! (to Tatar guys)
Don't behave badly. Live quietly.
At first, you started writing something, then finished it, and now you've started another thing, and here's the result)))
If you touch a woman's belly, they praise her. But if you don't touch her breasts, what kind of hero are you? 'What a great guy!!' really?
Hm... I've never seen such a road in Ufa, even when I left, I was still In Ufa. Don't make fun of Bashkiria!
Don't talk nonsense, what kind of Russians are you?! Tatar girls who respect themselves will never behave like that :)
So, what's wrong with the ticket inspectors? Are you guilty of buying a ticket or what?
Shut up!!!
What's wrong with you? Those girls who wear revealing clothes!
If that girl stood in front of me, I would scream
Tanzilya, you always eat fish heads, what kind of person are you?
Be more polite, please!!!!!! Or you'll be like terrorists!!
Tatar girls never go out with Russians!!!
Why do you always write in Russian??? All posts are in Russian. You're not Tatars, you're Russians.
So you want to make a doormat out of me, huh?
What a person. Ugh, to be like that!
Only an animal can behave like that!
Do you think you live in a bad country or what?
Take the cattle, boy, quickly!
I don't think people can't sit like animals here
just don't shout, Ilyas
Right! When I see a Tatar girl with a Russian guy, I want to kill them!
If they write in Tatar, they will start a fight, but in Russian, thely write whatever. That's why they are sold to the Russians!
One girl loves my boyfriend, I feel like killing her.
And in Tatarstan, they don't ask what Tatars need, it just make fun of them!
Oh, catch that guy... No one from Aktanysh would dare to talk like that!
You're the one who's writing and sitting, why be rude, Aynur?
Who put you in charge? Don't mess with me!
I wish the plane would take off already!
Write in Tatar.
Let's go in general let's get out of here
If our people are in trouble, what's the point? Should we go and get killed because we love Marjani?
If one of them comes and offends us, we'll say 'I don't care'
Don't fall for the fake, beware of the forgery
Why are you talking to yourself?
What a spring, the water is cold
For them, urine and water are the same.
Gulnara, a lot of time has passed, I guess
The main thing is health!
I don't know what kind of thing you're talking about, dude
Matvey, and what's with you, are you tired of your own meaningless chatter?
Don't flirt with other girls, they won't even notice you.
Well, you're just girls anyway.
If girls went to the army, would their guys stay or what? I don't get it!
It's not good to be friends with them, they'll lead you astray!
We're not going to Enkay, there are no girls, what's the point of going?
Most girls are like that, they flirt with guys and then dump them in the end!
Hey, hey anonymous, don't flirt with me in the photos! You're not my type!!!
lets not talk about it, and let's not discuss it
Are you guys tired of talking?! What's the point of chatting with you?!
You're just a guy who can't even get a girl!
Tatar guys are like that when they're drunk, just ignore them!
I'm free now! What was I waiting for?
Don't write such words and don't swear!!!
Why are you sitting there with your hands tied, get up and do something
what's wrong with you guys? are you out of your minds? What's your problem?
It's not shameful to ask questions, but it's bad to sit like you!
We're not afraid of anyone, but you guys are just unbrave who can't even look people in the eye
I'm so bored, what's up with you, dude?
You're worse than the people in the market, stop teasing people!
Dude, I'm telling you, enough!!!;-) what kind of nonsense is this...
I'm done with you, no need to say another word
And then they immediately start showing off - you're like a football player, I guess, don't need to do that
Can't you see they're just messing with you? Do you really think they care?
How many times will you get deceived?
Tatars are always like this, it seems
Lesya, there's a horse in the field, if you don't know what to do with it, don’t touch it!
Come back, Gata!
Look, they're all like sheep, just following each other
What's beauty got to do with it? Do you even know what beauty is?
I have had enough of these nestlings, I have written them off, I'm done
Made for the dark skinned, I won't take it, it's useless
Girls, if your boyfriend tells you to have sex, will you do it?
I'm tired of your 'where can I study?' questions, it's not an announcement!
Where were you, why didn't I see you around here?
I'm tired of your WhatsApp.
I think I've had enough, I'm done with you, I guess
Okay, I'll just sit in the toilet and...)
