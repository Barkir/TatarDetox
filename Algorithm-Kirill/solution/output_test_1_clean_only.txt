This cuckoo's child is not even a dog, it's not worth giving it away!
On the contrary, men buy them, and even the mind is not enough to give them away!
I'm tired of them!! I want to get to know them, but not like this!
They are so annoying!!!
What kind of Mishars are you, Vadim? - We don't have anyone to consider as a relative! Leave now, Don't say words that don’t make sense!!
Well, he has taken him. Where have you been, little one?
From the beginning, two children came out, one of them disappeared. Aaah, no one is left.
A month ago, I caught a big pike and took it home! If I were a liar, I wouldn't say it, but of course, brother, I'm telling the truth:-D
If I were a liar, I wouldn't say it, but of course, brother, I'm telling the truth
I know a girl who loves Zemfira. And I really love her!!! How can we find a compromise, huh??!
When will this group's nonsense end??? It's annoying!
A person who doesn't know anything started talking nonsense...
In short, there's no difference between Mishars and Tatars, it's not true that Mishar don't like Tatars. You can't even tell who's Tatar and who’s Mishar!!!
He showed the “kukish”, slammed the door shut, and propped it up with a wardrobe from the inside.
Regarding the restaurant, it's nothing, only the green walls are still standing.
Hey people! Tell me! What kind of chemistry are you on? A person asks for help, and you answer like addicts
I was very surprised when I came to Kazan from the village, Tatars speak Russian with each other!
@user, rewrite the course, where did I say that I didn't write to you? Change the record. If I had a hobby, I'd be a fisherman
I know the Russian group, I listened to the audio recording of Lev Leshchenko, where is it written in Tatar? I'll leave this place, don't worry about Allah's judgment!!!
I'm like this - without a referendum, they took away our referendum.
They already have our repertoire, they just copy records from other groups! Can't you think of two sentences yourself?
They bypassed the whole supermarket and found a hookah with grass. Which cabin is it in?
Taking a photo... we need to get acquainted!!!! (to Tatar guys)
Don't behave badly. Live quietly.
At first, you started writing something, then finished it, and now you've started another thing, and here's the result)))
If you touch a woman's belly, they praise her. But if you don't touch her breasts, what kind of hero are you? 'What a great guy!!' really?
Hm... I've never seen such a road in Ufa, even when I left, I was still In Ufa. Don't make fun of Bashkiria!
Don't talk nonsense, what kind of Russians are you?! Tatar girls who respect themselves will never behave like that :)
So, what's wrong with the ticket inspectors? Are you guilty of buying a ticket or what?
Shut up!!!
What's wrong with you? Those girls who wear revealing clothes!
If that girl stood in front of me, I would scream
Tanzilya, you always eat fish heads, what kind of person are you?
Be more polite, please!!!!!! Or you'll be like terrorists!!
Tatar girls never go out with Russians!!!
Why do you always write in Russian??? All posts are in Russian. You're not Tatars, you're Russians.
So you want to make a doormat out of me, huh?
What a person. Ugh, to be like that!
Only an animal can behave like that!
Do you think you live in a bad country or what?
Take the cattle, boy, quickly!
I don't think people can't sit like animals here
just don't shout, Ilyas
Right! When I see a Tatar girl with a Russian guy, I want to kill them!
If they write in Tatar, they will start a fight, but in Russian, thely write whatever. That's why they are sold to the Russians!
One girl loves my boyfriend, I feel like killing her.
And in Tatarstan, they don't ask what Tatars need, it just make fun of them!
Oh, catch that guy... No one from Aktanysh would dare to talk like that!
You're the one who's writing and sitting, why be rude, Aynur?
Who put you in charge? Don't mess with me!
I wish the plane would take off already! 
Write in Tatar.
Let's go in general let's get out of here
If our people are in trouble, what's the point? Should we go and get killed because we love Marjani?
If one of them comes and offends us, we'll say 'I don't care'
Don't fall for the fake, beware of the forgery
Why are you talking to yourself?
What a spring, the water is cold
For them, urine and water are the same.
Gulnara, a lot of time has passed, I guess
The main thing is health!
I don't know what kind of thing you're talking about, dude
Matvey, and what's with you, are you tired of your own meaningless chatter?
Don't flirt with other girls, they won't even notice you.
Well, you're just girls anyway.
If girls went to the army, would their guys stay or what? I don't get it!
It's not good to be friends with them, they'll lead you astray!
We're not going to Enkay, there are no girls, what's the point of going?
Most girls are like that, they flirt with guys and then dump them in the end!
Hey, hey anonymous, don't flirt with me in the photos! You're not my type!!!
lets not talk about it, and let's not discuss it
Are you guys tired of talking?! What's the point of chatting with you?!
You're just a guy who can't even get a girl!
Tatar guys are like that when they're drunk, just ignore them!
I'm free now! What was I waiting for?
Don't write such words and don't swear!!!
Why are you sitting there with your hands tied, get up and do something
what's wrong with you guys? are you out of your minds? What's your problem?
It's not shameful to ask questions, but it's bad to sit like you!
We're not afraid of anyone, but you guys are just unbrave who can't even look people in the eye
I'm so bored, what's up with you, dude?
You're worse than the people in the market, stop teasing people!
Dude, I'm telling you, enough!!!;-) what kind of nonsense is this...
I'm done with you, no need to say another word
And then they immediately start showing off - you're like a football player, I guess, don't need to do that
Can't you see they're just messing with you? Do you really think they care?
How many times will you get deceived?
Tatars are always like this, it seems
Lesya, there's a horse in the field, if you don't know what to do with it, don’t touch it!
Come back, Gata!
Look, they're all like sheep, just following each other
What's beauty got to do with it? Do you even know what beauty is?
I have had enough of these nestlings, I have written them off, I'm done
Made for the dark skinned, I won't take it, it's useless
Girls, if your boyfriend tells you to have sex, will you do it?
I'm tired of your 'where can I study?' questions, it's not an announcement!
Where were you, why didn't I see you around here?
I'm tired of your WhatsApp.
I think I've had enough, I'm done with you, I guess
Okay, I'll just sit in the toilet and...)
